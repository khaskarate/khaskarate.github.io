I am an AWS solutions architect by day, martial arts instructor by night.

I was born in Denver, grew up in Richmond and currently live Fairfax, VA. I am a father of 2 beautiful girls and married to the most amazing woman in the world. My hobbies include tennis, traveling, meeting people, and almost anything technology-related.
