      The great Zen Master, Bankei, was renowned for his talks. People of all sects and ranks came to listen to him because he spoke from his heart. Bankei was much-respected and his preaching was embraced by all.
Bankei’s popularity angered a priest of another sect whose followers left to listen to Bankei. The priest wondered what it was that made Bankei gain so many supporters, especially when Bankei did not even quote from any scholarly references!

      Two Zen monks, Tanzan and Ekido, were traveling on a pilgrimage. It was raining heavily and the streets were muddy. As the two monks neared a bend, they saw a beautiful maiden, dressed in silk and finery, standing by the bend. Being unable to cross the muddy intersection, she stood there, staring forlornly at the road ahead.
Without hesitation, Tanzan lifted the maiden in his arms. As a shocked Ekido watched, Tanzan carried the young girl over the mud and put her down at the end of the intersection.

Next morning, to everyone’s surprise, the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How amazing is that!” they exclaimed in excitement. The old man replied, “We’ll see.

No more will go in!&rdquo; the professor blurted. &ldquo;You are like this cup,&rdquo; the master replied, &ldquo;How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup.

His first arrow found its target, a far off bull’s eye, with ease; with his next shot, he split the first arrow into two.
“Think you can match that ?” he asked the old man condescendingly.
Instead of responding, the elderly monk gestured to the young man to follow him higher up the mountain.
