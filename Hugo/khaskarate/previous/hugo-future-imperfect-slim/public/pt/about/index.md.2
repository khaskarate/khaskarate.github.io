## About Kha's Karate

## Instructor bio
Sensei Kha Nguyen was born in Denver, CO, and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He received his first karate uniform and white belt at the age of four and has studied since. He and his five siblings learned karate from their father, Master Thinh Nguyen, who founded the Silkisondan Karate Association. Sensei Kha currently holds a fourth dan black belt in karate. When he's not teaching martial arts, Sensei Kha is a Linux system admin/AWS devops engineer. He lives in Fairfax, Virgniia, and spends his free time with his wife and two daughters.
