      <description>May 13, 2023 All, I am happy to announce that I have been nominated for fifth dan black belt which comes with the Master title. My promotion will be held this Saturday(5/13) at 10:00 AM at the karate school in Annandale. This is an experience that I&#39;d like to share with my peers, colleagues, and especially my students(past and present) and their family. I would like to invite everyone to attend.</description>
