      <description>Full Awareness After ten years of apprenticeship, Tenno achieved the rank of Zen teacher. One rainy day, he went to visit the famous master Nan-in. When he walked in, the master greeted him with a question, &amp;ldquo;Did you leave your wooden clogs and umbrella on the porch?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; Tenno replied.
&amp;ldquo;Tell me,&amp;rdquo; the master continued, &amp;ldquo;did you place your umbrella to the left of your shoes, or to the right?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>The Other Side One day a young Buddhist on his journey home came to the banks of a wide river. Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him, he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier.
Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher, “Oh wise one, can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river”?</description>

      <description>Empty Your Cup A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor&amp;rsquo;s cup to the brim, and then kept pouring.

No more will go in!&amp;rdquo; the professor blurted. &amp;ldquo;You are like this cup,&amp;rdquo; the master replied, &amp;ldquo;How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup.</description>
