      <description>Message from Master Thinh Dear Silkisondan Masters, Instructors, Black Belts, and Students:
I can’t even begin to tell you how much I look forward to seeing every one of you today. I have to take my wife to Vietnam to attend her father’s funeral. We lost him to lung cancer on Wednesday, March 16.
Vietnam is where I originally come from. I grew up and finished high school in 1970 and went to the US on April 27, 1971, as one of the few selected elite students for college education.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; Tenno replied.
&amp;ldquo;Tell me,&amp;rdquo; the master continued, &amp;ldquo;did you place your umbrella to the left of your shoes, or to the right?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Working Hard A martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly, “I am devoted to studying your martial system. How long will it take me to master it.”
The teacher’s reply was casual, “Ten years.” Impatiently, the student answered, “But I want to master it faster than that. I will work very hard. I will practice every day, ten or more hours a day if I have to. How long will it take then?</description>

      <description>The Other Side One day a young Buddhist on his journey home came to the banks of a wide river. Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him, he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier.
Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher, “Oh wise one, can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river”?</description>

The master poured the visitor&amp;rsquo;s cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s overfull! No more will go in!&amp;rdquo; the professor blurted. &amp;ldquo;You are like this cup,&amp;rdquo; the master replied, &amp;ldquo;How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup.</description>

      <description>Learning the Hard Way The son of a master thief asked his father to teach him the secrets of the trade. The old thief agreed and that night took his son to burglarize a large house. While the family was asleep, he silently led his young apprentice into a room that contained a clothes closet. The father told his son to go into the closet to pick out some clothes. When he did, his father quickly shut the door and locked him in.</description>
