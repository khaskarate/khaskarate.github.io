# Cup and Supporter policy

Kha's Karate School is dedicated to ensuring the health, safety, and comfort for all students during practice. Effective May 9, 2023, male students will be required to wear a cup & supporter to class. Only those wearing one will be allowed to spar. Cups and supporters are available for purchase; see Megan or Cinnamon for details.


Thank you for your understanding.
