# Mask policy

Kha's Karate School is dedicated to ensuring the health, safety, and comfort for all students during practice. As of November 7, 2022, masks are optional so long as community transmission remains low. Should transmission increase, we will return to wearing masks during class. 

Thank you for your understanding.
