Additional:
- Emergency closings: will follow that of Fairfax County Public Schools; makeup classes will be scheduled accordingly.
- FCPS Spring Break, FCPS Winter Break, FCPS holidays, government holidays: no class
- Week after Thanksgiving: no class; I will extend tuition accordingly

Lastly, even though I believe that martial arts is best studied with a class of varying ranks and ages, I understand that specific training for specific ranks and levels is equally beneficial. I want to emphasize that our training becomes more clear from a perspective that is not of one's own: ie a black belt can best see their progress in the presence of white belts, and vice versa. Eventually, rank becomes less important and allows us to study the true meaning of martial arts. So despite the above changes - and space permitting - I always invite students of each class to practice with those of other classes. 

Thank you,
Sensei Kha
