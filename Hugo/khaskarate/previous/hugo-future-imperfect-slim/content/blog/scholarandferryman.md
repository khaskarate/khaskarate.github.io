## The scholar & ferryman

The scholar got on a small boat and asked a young ferryman to take him a cross a river.

The scholar started the conversation.  

"Do you know history?", asked the scholar
"I am sorry no", replied the ferryman

"Do you know geographic?", asked again the scholar
"I am sorry no", replied again the ferryman

"Do you know fortune telling?", asked again the scholar
"I am sorry no", replied the ferryman

"You waste and lose half of your life!", The scholar concluded

A moment later, the heavy rain and storm came.

"Do you know how to swim?"  Asked the young ferryman
"No, I don't" The scholar replied.

"You are about to lose your whole life!"  said the young ferryman.

That is wisdom!!!!


###  The lesson:  Wisdom is the most important.  It's beyond and above knowledge.  It requires constant studies of every situation.
