From Megan...   

Craving your favorite Girl Scout Cookies? I've got you!   

Now you can order the most delicious cookies right from the comfort and safety of your living room through my Digital CookieÂ® site, where you'll also see my goal and a special message from me. You'll be supporting my success, helping me learn essential skills, and powering new, unique, and amazing experiences for me and my troop all year long!  

(You're the best!)  

And if you have already bought Girl Scout Cookies this year, that's OK! Maybe you would like to buy a few more to stock up for yourself, give to family and friends, or to donate. Any way you slice it, it's a sweet deal. Plus, I may earn a personalized patch with my name on it!  

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
