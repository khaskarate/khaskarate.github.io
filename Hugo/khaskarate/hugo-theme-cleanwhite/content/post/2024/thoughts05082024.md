The Karate Bow

What does it mean to bow to another student or instructor?  It means "teach me".

You bow 3 times:   
1 - When you come in  
2 - To the teacher  
3 - When you leave  

The first bow means love  
The second bow means "stay calm"  
The third bow means  enlightenment. Try to travel, find out how you are. Learn about yourself.
