## Thoughts from Master Thinh

### Kicking with the back leg versus kicking with the front leg...

The front leg is meant as a means of checking your opponent. You generate the most power using your back leg.


### Reset
The thought of the reset in sparring is similar to boxers throwing a number of punches at each other and then breaking for a moment before throwing another set of punches. In karate we call this the reset. During a sparring session students should be able to exchange a number of techniques before resetting.

On the topic of sparring.
