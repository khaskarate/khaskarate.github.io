      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;finding-a-diamond-on-a-muddy-road&#34;&gt;Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gudo was the emperor&amp;rsquo;s teacher of his time. Nevertheless, he used to travel alone as a wandering mendicant. Once when he was on his way to Edo, the cultural and political center of the shogunate, he approached a little village named Takenaka. It was evening and a heavy rain was falling. Gudo was thoroughly wet. His straw sandals were in pieces. At a farmhouse near the village he noticed four or five pairs of sandals in the window and decided to buy some dry ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When he walked in, the master greeted him with a question, &amp;ldquo;Did you leave your wooden clogs and umbrella on the porch?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; Tenno replied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tell me,&amp;rdquo; the master continued, &amp;ldquo;did you place your umbrella to the left of your shoes, or to the right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;working-hard&#34;&gt;Working Hard&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A martial arts student went to his teacher and said earnestly, “I am devoted to studying your martial system. How long will it take me to master it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher’s reply was casual, “Ten years.” Impatiently, the student answered, “But I want to master it faster than that. I will work very hard. I will practice every day, ten or more hours a day if I have to. How long will it take then?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Staring hopelessly at the great obstacle in front of him, he pondered for hours on just how to cross such a wide barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as he was about to give up his pursuit to continue his journey he saw a great teacher on the other side of the river. The young Buddhist yells over to the teacher, “Oh wise one, can you tell me how to get to the other side of this river”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In addition to learning from you, I&amp;rsquo;d like to study with another teacher in order to learn another style. What do you think of this idea?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The hunter who chases two rabbits,&amp;rdquo; answered the master, &amp;ldquo;catches neither one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;empty-your-cup&#34;&gt;Empty Your Cup&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor&amp;rsquo;s cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s overfull! No more will go in!&amp;rdquo; the professor blurted. &amp;ldquo;You are like this cup,&amp;rdquo; the master replied, &amp;ldquo;How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-the-hard-way&#34;&gt;Learning the Hard Way&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The son of a master thief asked his father to teach him the secrets of the trade. The old thief agreed and that night took his son to burglarize a large house. While the family was asleep, he silently led his young apprentice into a room that contained a clothes closet. The father told his son to go into the closet to pick out some clothes. When he did, his father quickly shut the door and locked him in. Then he went back outside, knocked loudly on the front door, thereby waking the family, and quickly slipped away before anyone saw him. Hours later, his son returned home, bedraggled and exhausted. &amp;ldquo;Father,&amp;rdquo; he cried angrily, &amp;ldquo;Why did you lock me in that closet? If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been made desperate by my fear of getting caught, I never would have escaped. It took all my ingenuity to get out!&amp;rdquo; The old thief smiled. &amp;ldquo;Son, you have had your first lesson in the art of burglary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
