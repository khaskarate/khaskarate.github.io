Wisdom you look outside? Never stop\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut best way that\u0026rsquo;s where. If you if you keep doing it, there\u0026rsquo;s some point in time you become more aware where you don\u0026rsquo;t need to take time right? So you can react immediately but how do you get there? Teach them I just say hey let\u0026rsquo;s throw a punch. Keep punching you say no that\u0026rsquo;s wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s right. Yeah that\u0026rsquo;s technical but what is beyond right? Because when you teach, you don\u0026rsquo;t really ask a student right? You walk with the student too. Find the answer for them. You you know the answer for you already correct? So when you teach martial art you are actually bring yourself to them level and to be one of them. So when you practice practice for both to get to that point and keep improving if that makes sense. You can take off the events no. But he\u0026rsquo;s saying bring it bring your level to their level. So if you are black belt to so they can figure it out on their own they can walk and they own with some of your instructions. But you don\u0026rsquo;t make them like behind a stick. Force them but help them encourage them. So so how do you get to the point that you be totally awaren? That\u0026rsquo;s the that\u0026rsquo;s the question. Okay let\u0026rsquo;s say you you play this right? Yes, you practice right so you keep practicing it and sometimes you make mistakes. Sometime you play better than the other. But when do you get to the point that you feel is right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s the same as as martial arts or play tennis. Or I mean you know the professional when they serve the ball goes so quick. If you think about it you done. Just no way that you can think of that. The ball goes so fast. So what is how do you get yourself to that level? Okay, when when you think about something when you think about something do not doing fully right? You need to learn to the point you don\u0026rsquo;t need to think about. First of all, like music, right? You don\u0026rsquo;t have to memorize right? You can just play it. So the first level you learn ABC right? And after ABC you play the song and after that you keep practicing and what from there? What above that teaching because people pick you out for you to play violin in that group. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason not just put what is that? When it come to an art when it come to performance dedication thing it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s the top okay. When you listen to somebody who sing is that person in that song or the song in that person? Let me hear the thing karate the same way is karate in you or you in karate? Hello Sarah, what are you? What? What do you think so karate in you so it is on your mind right? But your mind is not on crying how about if we say this? This possibility karate is not even in you and you not even in karate because if the karate in you that just memory if you in karate if you are in karate in history, you\u0026rsquo;re not in presence. Is that right? Or is not right now where I can where I can talk to you this way inside and out. Okay let me ask you this. Okay? Let me just karate is the time bound that mean you have a time factor in karate just like love right? Just like if you love your dad or your mom, you don\u0026rsquo;t you don\u0026rsquo;t say hey. I only love you from 8:00 to 9:00 8:00 p.m. Right? You don\u0026rsquo;t so so is that love in you or you in love? To get a total picture right? Or the student in you? You in all the student? Can you see it so when when you\u0026rsquo;re in front of the class when you teach you feel like you should touch all of them and all of them should be in you. So what is attention? You want a student to pay attention to you right? So what is attention? What is focus? Don\u0026rsquo;t depend on words so much because one lead to another. What is attention? Okay attention mean total total total. Whatever it is that you attend nothing else. It present not in the past tension or attendance. Attention attention. What is paying attention exactly? That mean nothing in the past. Just here they they look at you. Whatever you say, whatever you do that\u0026rsquo;s they pay attention to it right now. Nothing else. No pass.
