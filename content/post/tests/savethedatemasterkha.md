<p>
All,
I am happy to announce that I have been nominated for fifth dan black belt which comes with the Master title. My promotion will be held this Saturday(5/13) at 10:00 AM at the karate school in Annandale. This is an experience that I'd like to share with my peers, colleagues, and especially my students(past and present) and their family. I would like to invite everyone to attend. 

A luncheon will follow the test and should start around 11:30AM. I am also reaching out for volunteers to help with organizing and preparing the food; please reach out directly to Cinnamon (cinnapham@gmail.com) if you would like to help.

Thank you,
Sensei Kha
