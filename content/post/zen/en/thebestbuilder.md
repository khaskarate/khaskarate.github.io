# The Best Builder

The richest landowner in the village who made so much money in his career and decide to retire.  He looked for the best builder in the city to build a house.

He came across one and the best builder who also decided to build one more house before he retired.  Both seemed to be a perfect match for each other.

Both agreed on pricing and construction schedule.  

The build thought that this was his last house and he did not need good reputation.  He recklessly built a house that he did not normally built before.  The house was done before the due date.

At the delivery date, the landowner paid him all the money and gave him the house key, then said:  "You have done so much for the city; therefore, I want to reward you with this house.".

Lesson:  Quality and honest work is a must in every case.
