A journey - Karate Student Oath - Forever Karate Blue Print


I want to take a moment to share a story with all of you—a story about how this journey of martial arts, discipline, and growth began for me. It’s a story that started on April 27, 1971, when I left Vietnam, heading to the United States with a clear mission in mind: to complete my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering as part of the Vietnamization program, which aimed to replace U.S. military officers in South Vietnam.

As I sat on that Air France plane for the first time, flying toward Hawaii before continuing on to San Francisco, I had no idea where life would take me. But I did know that my journey wasn’t just about education or a professional career—it was about something more personal. I had always been drawn to martial arts. It was a passion I couldn't shake, something deep inside me that I knew would eventually play a significant role in my life.

Over the years, I worked hard to develop myself both academically and personally. I never lost sight of my martial arts aspirations, and through persistence and dedication, I eventually found myself teaching karate. Along the way, I met many incredible students, but one, Oak, stands out as a special part of that journey. Teaching and sharing this art with all of you, helping you grow, and watching each of you evolve into stronger, more disciplined individuals has been one of the greatest rewards of my life.

You all may not know it, but when I see you practice and improve, it reminds me of my own journey. Just like I once stood in your shoes—facing challenges, overcoming obstacles, and growing through discipline—I see each of you working toward your own goals. Whether you're here to improve your technique, your strength, or your mental focus, remember that every step you take is an important part of your personal growth.

Martial arts is not just about the moves; it's about the lessons we learn along the way—about perseverance, respect, patience, and humility. It’s about pushing ourselves to become better, not just on the mat, but in life. Each of you has the potential to achieve amazing things, and I’m honored to be part of your journey.

I look forward to continuing to grow together, and I am incredibly proud of each one of you for the effort, discipline, and passion you bring to this art.

Thank you for being a part of this organization. Keep striving, keep learning, and keep pushing forward. Your journey has just begun.

With respect and gratitude,

Master Thinh
