Master Kha’s birthday and Megan’s high school graduation are both approaching—two meaningful milestones for individuals who have brought joy, dedication, and inspiration to our lives.

To honor them and express my deep appreciation and admiration, I would like to present them with the following gift. This gesture is a small token of gratitude for all they have accomplished and for the positive impact they continue to make.

What Is Zen?  
* Zen is a school of Buddhism that emphasizes:  
* Direct experience over theory or scripture  
* Awareness of the present moment  
* Letting go of ego and attachment  
* Living simply and mindfully  

It’s both a spiritual philosophy and a way of life—focused on seeing things as they really are, beyond thinking or labels.

What Is Meditation?  

* Meditation is a mental practice that:
* Trains the mind to focus, observe, and calm down
* Can take many forms: breathing, chanting, visualization, mindfulness, etc.
* Is used in many traditions (not just Buddhism)

In Zen, the main form of meditation is zazen, or "just sitting"—calm, alert, with no goal except to be fully present.

Are Zen and Meditation the Same?  
No—but they are deeply connected.

Zen:  A spiritual path and worldview while Meditation:  A mental discipline or technique  
Zen:  Includes meditation, mindfulness, ethics, art, and daily awareness while Meditation:  Focuses on training the mind through stillness and awareness  
Zen:  Seeks awakening to the nature of reality while Meditation:  Builds clarity, calm, and insight


You can meditate without being Zen, but you can’t truly practice Zen without meditation.
