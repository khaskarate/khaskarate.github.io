During recent classes I mentioned that I've had changes in my day job and subsequently need to make changes to the class schedule. Effective February 17, 2025, Tuesday and Thursday classes will no longer be available. I invite students to attend the 5:30 class if that better fits your schedule. I hope this change does not negatively impact you. Additionally the schedule - along with closings can be found at https://www.khaskarate.com/schedule/. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
