One prerequisite for promotion to black belt will be that advanced brown belts will be required to demonstrate competency in running class while working out with said class. This includes: 
* Leading the student oath
* Warmups
* Basics
* Drills
* Forms
* 1 step sparring<br>
(No free sparring, no board breaking)

An instructor will be present at all times. Standard and intermediate brown belt students may be asked to participate in running small portions of the class. Credit will be applied towards their promotion.

### Additional Requirements for promotion to black belt
