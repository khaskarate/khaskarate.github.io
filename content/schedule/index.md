# Class Schedule 
The original karate school was esablished in Annandale, Virginia, in 2016, and we have since been fortunate to be able to expand the class size and allow for practice at the location in Falls Church. I will continue to support the original location. I encourage all students to begin attending the Falls Church location, which is where I plan to focus my efforts. Pleae contact me directly if you have any questions about this.
