## About Silkisondan Karate
Silkisondan Karate is a system developed by Master Thinh Nguyen, 7th Dan, which is based in the original International Taekwondo Federation (ITF) style of Tae Kwon Do.  Master Nguyen traveled to China and Japan where he earned equally high rankings in Judo, Kung Fu, and Karate.  

Many years before the mixed martial arts craze, Master Nguyen combined these styles into a balanced martial arts system. Silkisondan Karate holds true to the traditional values of the martial arts.  Our instructors teach from a love, respect and passion for these traditions.  They earn their living elsewhere, so teaching is not a vocation for our Sensei; it is a calling. We have classes available in central Virginia area: including Richmond, Hanover (Mechanicsville), New Kent, and Goochland; In Northern Virginia: Ananndale, VA, and Florida: Tallahassee.

Silkisondan roughly translates as "the Way of the Flowering Path."  As life is a journey, so are the martial arts. With each day we grow and develop at our own individual pace and we enjoy the path as it opens or "flower"s along the way.

In the Silkisondan Karate Association our mantra is "Karate for Life."  Those who join our association will earn their rank at their own pace.   And for them, the martial arts will become a way of life, a journey into ourselves, a journey of understanding. As Master Nguyen says, "Know yourself; Improve yourself."
